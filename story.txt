Every fourth centernial moon, the young of the stone blubber clan must dive into the ocean in an attempt to "Chill With Daddy Posideon". Only one member of the clan has succeded, and he was a little drunk. The young know that fish are food, not friends, and that sharks are bad and will eat you. They also know that air is important to survival. You must know these things. GO FORTH! BE FREE! AND DROWN ALOT!
